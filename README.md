# Pooled Staking Dashboard

A project that integrates P2Ps staking and restaking API functionalities to provide a way for users to stake in a pool.

This project was created as part of the 2025 Eigen Games following the P2P track.

## Features

- **Deposit and Staking/Restaking Functionality:**  
  Deposit ETH into a pooled smart contract. Your ETH will be stake and restaked via P2P's staking and restaking api.

- **Delegator Summary:**  
  View real-time details such as APY, your staked ETH, total rewards in the pool, and a breakdown of individual rewards.

Sample Data:
The sampleData.js file contains example data for testing the Delegator Summary. We were unable to test the Data API without a valid delegator.
